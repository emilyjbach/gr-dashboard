# GR Dashboard
An open-source dashboard that visualizes all GR 237 data, from 2015 to 2025. 

Possible version updates: 
1. Auto-upload new CDSS data: Would need two nested clauses, 1) to download updated data from existing yearly spreadsheet: download, conv to csv, del s1 and s3, re-name, replace existing file. 2) (or uploading new yearly spreadsheet) should be done manually to confirm/check cols and matching.
2. Would be cool if it could flag any interesting data but would have to think much, much more about what is "interesting" to train it on.
